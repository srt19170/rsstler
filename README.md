# Rsstler

Rsstler is a Firefox extension for reading RSS feeds.  By default, it
mimics much of the look & feel of Google Reader.  It runs entirely in
the browser (so you are not dependent upon any third-party websites)
but uses Firefox bookmark synchronization to try to synchronize your
reading across multiple computers. (So that something you read on your
home computer shows up as read on your work computer, for example.)

## Quickstart

Install the Rsstler extension from the Mozilla Addons website
[here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rsstler/).  This
should add a Rsstler button to your toolbar (if not, you can add it by
using the Firefox Customize function).  Click on this button, or type
Alt-R, or navigate to "chrome://rsstler/content/rsstler.html" to open
Rsstler.  If you're familiar with Google Reader you'll find most
things work as you expect.  For more detailed information, use the ?
button in the upper right to open the User's Guide.

## Known Issues

* NoScript ClearClick sometimes interferes with Rsstler by
  "swallowing" mouse clicks that are intended for Rsstler.  If you
  have this problem you can disable the NoScript ClearClick
  functionality in that extension, or simply click again until the
  mouse click gets through to Rsstler.

* Nested folders in the Rsstler list of feeds don't display very well;
  they aren't indented as they probably should be.
